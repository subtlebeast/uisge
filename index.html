      <h2>Talisker</h2>
        
        <!-- <p>My first dram of Talisker relieved me of some of the agony of life. It was like a descent into a warm and hidden forest pool with my true love - in a world without Mondays. I know that it is dangerous to suggest that an alcoholic drink can produce such ecstasy, but it can.</p> --> 

        <p>Talisker is made on the isle of Skye, which is in the northern Inner Hebrides. It's the only distillery on Skye, which is a little surprising to those who may have heard of the famed [southern] Hebridean Isle of Islay ("eye-la"), which which boasts an astonishng eight Scotch distilleries. Talisker is similar to the Islay whiskies in that it has a maritime character (salt, sea air, seaweed) and it's made with peat. It is, however, unique in flavor, as are, indeed, all whiskies. [Indeed there is great variation even on Islay. Bruichladdich's flagship expression, for example, is not made with peat, while Laphroaig is the peat-reekiest (in a good way) whisky of them all.]</p>  

        <p>Like many great whiskies, Talisker has a rich history (Robert Louis Stevenson was apparently a fan), and this somehow causes one to feel that one can't really know the whisky unless one visits the place of its origin and breathes its particular atmosphere. This is of course nonsense, but it is the sort of nonsense that is happily pondered.</p>

      <h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

        <p>Leaves. The smell of an ocean breeze careening off jagged rocks. Salt. A lingering finish of tellicherry peppercorns. Evocative of the phrase "sandpaper smooth."</p> 
  
      <h2>Kirkland/Costco "Speyside" 20yr</h2>
        <p>My wife bought this from Costco (which, perhaps unsurprisingly, is a good place to look for reasonably priced, yet quality, whisky) a while ago, and I really enjoy it. According to <a href="http://scotchnoob.com/2013/04/22/kirkland-speyside-sherry-cask-finish-20-year/">Scotch Noob</a>, Costco's earlier "Speyside" offerings were bottlings of The Macallan (which is, incidentally, Neil Peart's favorite whisky), but this one may not be, since The Macallan appears nowhere on its label. Either way, it's worth the price. <!-- Though age doesn't really have much to do with whisky quality, at 20 years, this is the oldest bottle in my collection. I don't know why, but I like to drink this and think back two decades, to when it was bottled. I was in high school then, and I think the feeling of wellbeing that it gives me has somwething to do with my memory of Jennifer's calves. --> 

      <h3>Tasting Notes</h3>
        <p>Wood. Cinnamon. Butter and brown sugar. Spiciness. The sweet hits you first, the spicy hits you later. A lingering peppery finish.</p>

      <h2>Drinking With Toru</h2>
        <p>Toru Takemitsu taught me how to enjoy whisky. To listen to Takemitsu's music is not to look to the future, but to pause and attend to the moment. What is this chord that he's given us? How has he chosen to orchestrate it? Now, we're in a pool of silence. How did he frame this silence? What came before? What will he meet it with? This is music, in other words, that floats out of time. It is unmoored from the future and the past. Like the moment one raises a glass, it is a celebration of now.</p>
        
        <p>Before I go further into the specifics of how I like to experience whisky, let me emphasize that there is no wrong way to drink it. Whisky is meant to be enjoyed, and if you enjoy it on the rocks, so be it (although watching someone drink whisky on the rocks makes me cringe even more than when I hear someone order their steak well done). But, what is true for classical music is also true of whisky; a little education can enhance the experience immeasurably. With that in mind, I offer the following.</p>
        
        <p>First, the concept of "drinking" whisky is misleading, for the drinking of the substance is merely one small aspect of its enjoyment. Whisky is a companion that appeals to all of the senses, as well as to one's sense of style.</p>

        <p>The first thing that I do on a whisky-blessed evening is consider the silhouette of the bottle. Some bottles, like Scapa's, are breathtakingly elegant. Others, like Jura's, are squat and serious looking. I like to think that the shape of each particular whisky's bottle is no accident, that someone at some time in the history of that particular distillery gave consideration to the bottle and determined that <em>that</em> particular shape, whatever it is, best captures the personality of their particular malt.</p>

        <p>Next, I pour a glass and contemplate the color. I know that some distilleries color their whiskies for consistency and, though I wish this were not the case, it doesn't bother me too much. Again, I like to think that thought was given to way the whisky presents in-glass. [I won't, here, talk about whisky glasses. The buying of whisky-specific glasses seems overly-burdensome and expensive. The best glass is one that curls slightly inward at the top, to capture the scent, but use whatever you have at hand. I use a red wine glass.]</p>

        <p>Following the pour, I swirl the whisky to loosen it a little and release some of its odors. Many whisky drinkers add a touch of purified water to unspool the aromas even further, but I don't. Probably, the addition of water is preferred, but it's more effort than I'm willing to bear. Whisky drinking should be the opposite of tedious. I drink my whisky neat.</p>

        <p>Over the course of the next several minutes, I sniff the whisky as it opens. Nosing the glass is the most important part of the whisky experience. The dram reveals more of itself to you as you spend more time in its company. In Speyside whiskies, like The Glenlivet, for example, initial sweet notes of apple give way to understones of small flower earthiness.</p>

        <p>After some time nosing, take a sip. Let the liquid roll over your tongue and attend to how it affects your various taste buds. Initially, it will burn, but don't swallow. As with the nosing, let it reveal itself to you. You will begin to taste new flavors under the initial sensation of alcohol. What are they? Vanilla? Smoke? Try to catalogue them. Like the carefuly selected tones in one of Takemitsu's chords, appreciate how they work together to make something unexpectedly beautiful.</p>

        <p>After you swallow, pay attention to the finish. How long does it last? What is its flavor legacy?</p>

        <p>I will tell you that I was brought to whisky by my work. It is trying work that I do. It is draining and saddening and frustrating work. I have listened to Takemitsu's <i>Toward the Sea</i> in the dark and relied upon it to pull me through. And I have called on whisky equally. Not as an escape. No, not at all. But as a reminder of why <em>not</em> to escape. As a confirmation that there are things in this life that we should rush toward and embrace.</p>
