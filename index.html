      <h2>Talisker</h2>
        <p>The day I first tasted Talisker was the day Glen O'Grady lost his appeal. O'Grady wasn't my client, but I'd helped Kim on the brief, and I'd come to believe O'Grady'd gotten kind of screwed. But the judge wasn't bothered by it, and she denied the appeal, and Glen slowly shuffled his chained self out the door to exist the rest of his life away. And that night I had my first dram of Talisker.</p> 

        </p>Talisker is made on the isle of Skye, which is in the northern Inner Hebrides. It's the only distillery on Skye, which is a little confusing to some people because they might have heard of the famed Isle of Islay ("eye-la"), which is also in the [southern] Hebrides and which boasts eight Scotch distilleries. Talisker is similar to the Islay whiskies in that it has a maritime character (salt, sea air, seaweed) and it's made with peat. It is, however, unique in flavor, as are each of the Islay whiskies from one another [Indeed, Bruichladdich's flagship expression is not made with peat.]</p>  

        <p>Like many great whiskies, Talisker has a rich history (Robert Louis Stevenson was apparently a fan), and this somehow causes one to feel that one can't really know the whisky unless one visit the places of its birth and breathe its particular atmosphere. This is of course nonsense, but like the  exposed neckline and shoulder of the young woman who stands next to one awaiting a green line train in the summertime, it is the sort of thing that is happily pondered. That first dram of Talisker, in other words, relieved me of some of the agony of this life. It was like a descent into a warm and hidden forest pool with my true love - in a world without Mondays. I know that it is dangerous to suggest that an alcoholic drink can produce such an ecstatic change in attitude. Nonetheless, it's can. </p>
