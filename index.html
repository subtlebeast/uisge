      <h2>Talisker</h2>
        
        <p>My first dram of Talisker relieved me of some of the agony of life. It was like a descent into a warm and hidden forest pool with my true love - in a world without Mondays. I know that it is dangerous to suggest that an alcoholic drink can produce such an ecstatic change in attitude. Nonetheless, it can.</p> 

        </p>Talisker is made on the isle of Skye, which is in the northern Inner Hebrides. It's the only distillery on Skye, which is a little surprising to those who may have heard of the famed Isle of Islay ("eye-la"), which is also in the [southern] Hebrides, and which boasts an astonishng eight Scotch distilleries. Talisker is similar to the Islay whiskies in that it has a maritime character (salt, sea air, seaweed) and it's made with peat. It is, however, unique in flavor, as are, indeed, all whiskies, including those made on Islay. [Bruichladdich's flagship expression, for example, is not made with peat, even though it is distilled quite near to Laphroaig, the peat-reekiest (in a good way) whisky of them all.]</p>  

        <p>Like many great whiskies, Talisker has a rich history (Robert Louis Stevenson was apparently a fan), and this somehow causes one to feel that one can't really know the whisky unless one visits the place of its origin and breathes its particular atmosphere. This is of course nonsense, but it is the sort of nonsense that is happily pondered.</p>

      <h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

        <p>Leaves. The smell of an ocean breeze careening off jagged rocks. Salt. A lingering finish of tellicherry peppercorns. Evocative of the phrase "sandpaper smooth."</p>
